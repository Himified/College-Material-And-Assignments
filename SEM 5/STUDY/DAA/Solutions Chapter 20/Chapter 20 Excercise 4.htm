Suppose there is a feasible loading of all containers onto the to ships.
Consider any feasible loading of the two ships.
Let the amount loaded into the first ship be <code class="var">X</code>.
Let <code class="var">W</code> be the sum of the <code class="var">w<sub>i</sub></code>s.
The amount loaded into the second ship is <code class="var">W-X &lt;=
c<sub>2</sub></code>.
Suppose that the amount loaded into the first ship is <code class="var">Y</code>
when we load this ship as close to its capacity as possible.
Since <code class="var">Y &gt;= X</code>, <code class="var">W-Y &lt; = W-X &lt;=
c<sub>2</sub></code>.  Therefore, the remainder fits into the second ship
and a feasible loading is obtained.
