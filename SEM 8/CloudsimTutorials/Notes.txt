Cloudsim
- Framework made in java
- Simulates cloud services
- Collection of Java Classes representing different features of cloud
- It models DataCenter, Host, VM, Cloudlets
DataCenter: It is a place which is a collection of resources (collection of hosts). This is a class in CloudSim and is modelled in real life as collection of physical machines.
Host: It represents a physical machine. It has variables to represent memory, processors, id, scheduling scheme, etc.
VM: Each host can have a virtual machine. On these VM, our task/applications are executed.
Cloudlet: It represents a user task

There are two main areas to be scheduled:
i) Allocation of Processor to VM (Vm Scheduler) - Suppose Host has 2 cores/processors and there are 4 VMs on this Host then which Processor to which VM
ii) Submission of Cloudlet to VM (Cloudlet Scheduler) - Which task to be given to VM?

Space Shared - (kind of FCFS)Processor will be allocated to one VM at one time. Once task is completed by one VM then only it goes to the next VM.
Time Shared - One Processor can be shared by 2 VMs at the same time. Context switching takes place.
Now the above can happed for VM and for Cloudlet
For Pic1.jpg
a - VM Space shared, Cloudlet Space Shared
b - VM Space Shared, Cloudlet Time Shared
c - VM Time Shared, Cloudlet Space Shared
d - VM Time Shared, Cloudlet Time Shared

DataCenter Broker - This class models a broker, which is responsible for mediating negotiations between SaaS and Cloud providers. IT sits between the cloud provider and the user.
DataCenter Characteristics - Configuration information of data center resources.
VmAllocationPolicy - This class represents a provisioning policy that a VM monitor utilizes for allocating VMs to Hosts.
FederatedDataCenter - Collection of different types of DataCenter.

Initialize CloudSim
Create DataCenter - HostList, PeList, Characteristics
Create DataCenter Broker
Create VM
submit VM list to the broker
Create Cloudlet
submit Cloudlet list to the broker
Starts the simulation
Print results when simulation is over
